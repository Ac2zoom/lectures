MWL Lecture 2 Notes
Trees

1. Decision Trees
    - Initially, all the data exists in the root node.
    - We then make axis perpindicular splits to seperate the classes.
    - The rest of the tree can be built recursively in the same fashion.
    - When a potential node split fails to provide enough "utility", the splitting stops
        and that node becomes a leaf node.
    - The "class" of a leaf node is determined by a majority vote of its members.
    - Can be used for multi-way classification, but we will examine the binary
        classification case.
    - Why don't we use k-ary trees, k >= 3, instead of binary trees?
        (Hint: What could a k-ary tree do that a binary tree couldn't?)
