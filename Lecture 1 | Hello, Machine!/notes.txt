    - MATH 498. Math Sciences Seminar. Marina Meila teaches it. Should be awesome.

2. What is Machine Learning?
    - Teaching (programming) a machine to derive patterns from data.
    - In general, there are three types of tasks we may ask our machine to perform:
        1. Supervised Learning - 'labeled' data
            > Classification
            > Regression
        2. Unsupervised Learning - 'unlabeled' data
            > Cluster Analysis
            > Other fancy things, like PCA
        3. Reinforcement Learning - 'dynamic' data, or learning by doing (like 
            driving a car, playing chess against an opponent, etc.)
    - For the first few lectures at least, we will only talk about supervised learning.

3. Supervised Learning
    - We are given an n-dimensional feature vector, and its corresponding label.
        > In the case of classification, our label exists within some
            predefined finite set of objects.
        > In the case of regression, our label (usually) exists in the reals.
        > These aren't entirely mutually exclusive tasks. (Why not?)
    - Our goal: derive a statistical model from our labeled data, so that we may
        predict the label of (unlabeled) future observations.
    - First we must choose a model, then we must optimize the parameters
        of our model (also called "fitting" a model, more on this later).
