NumPy is a big reason why Python is the de-facto language for data science. It's a powerful library 
offering Matlab-like tools in a flexible programming environment. "Tensor manipulation programming" 
(that is, writing code that simply manipulates n-dimensional matrices) has also seen a rise in popularity
in the recent years, since many neural network operations can be easily expressed and parallelized as tensor 
operations.

Towards learning how to use recent libraries for working with tensors like Tensorflow, Torch, or Theano, it's
very helpful to know how NumPy works; in fact, you can think of many of the aformentioned libraries as NumPy
specifically tuned for machine learning, since they all operate on tensors and indeed, Tensorflow and other 
libraries try their best to play nice with NumPy data structures and have their functions behave identically 
to those in NumPy.

In that vein, we'll be talking through a few important NumPy concepts that extend to other libraries (e.g. broadcasting)
and working through some [numpy exercises](https://github.com/Kyubyong/numpy_exercises).
